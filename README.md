This repository contains a small project for the course Computational physics at TU Delft. 

The simulation can be performed by running [main](main.py). The project was finalised by a presentation that can be found [here](NLC.pptx). The sources of the project can be found on the last slide of mentioned powerpoint. The project is based on "A Program To Simulate a Nematic Liquid Crystal In 2-D
for Use in Computer-Assisted Education" by Eric C. Hemenway and Adrian P. Wade.
